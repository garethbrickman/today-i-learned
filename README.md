Indexing a database typically means mapping a binary tree data structure onto the dataset. This makes it more efficient to search for data because you can use the same kind of algorithm as you'd use to find a fiction book at the library.

In a git repo, find when a certain string was first added in the codebase:
```git log -G string_to_look_for --reverse```

Test curl to localhost
```
nc -l <port number>
```

```
curl http://localhost:<port number>/
```
